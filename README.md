Lung Cancer Diagnosis and Region Localization Using Deep Learning
This project combines classification and segmentation models for lung CT analysis. It uses Inception V3 for classifying images into benign, malignant, or normal categories and leverages a U-Net model to localize affected regions in malignant scans. The pipeline addresses class imbalance, incorporates data augmentation, and integrates precise region-based analysis to assist in early detection and detailed diagnosis of lung cancer.

Features:
Classification of CT images into three categories: benign, malignant, and normal.
Segmentation of malignant images to localize affected regions using U-Net.
Comprehensive pipeline combining classification and localization for medical imaging.
